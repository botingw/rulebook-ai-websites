# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Motive:
To provide a comprehensive and optimal Custom User Prompt (Rules) framework for AI coding assistants (Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, Windsurf). This template addresses the challenge of inconsistent AI behavior and context management, particularly in complex software projects. By leveraging established software engineering principles and a structured documentation system (Memory Bank), it aims to significantly improve the quality, consistency, and effectiveness of AI-assisted development, enabling users to build sophisticated applications with AI partners that deeply understand project context.

## Target Audience:
This template is primarily designed for:
*   **Developers working on complex projects:** Those requiring deep context, structured workflows, and consistent AI assistance beyond basic code generation or prototyping.
It is also beneficial for:
*   **Teams using multiple AI coding assistants:** Ensuring consistency in workflow and AI behavior across different tools.
*   **Individuals seeking a more structured AI workflow:** Implementing proven software engineering practices for AI collaboration.
*   **Researchers needing reproducible AI interactions:** Providing a stable framework for experiments.
*   **Anyone looking to improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated code and documentation.**

## Goals:
*   Provide a robust, cross-platform framework for consistent and context-aware AI coding assistance across supported platforms.
*   Enable developers to effectively leverage AI for complex software projects by enforcing best practices and maintaining persistent project memory.
*   Reduce setup time and configuration inconsistencies when using multiple AI coding tools.
*   Serve as a shareable, adaptable foundation for high-quality AI pair-programming.

## Success Metrics:
*   **Adoption:** Achieve [Target Number, e.g., 100+] GitHub stars and [Target Number, e.g., 20+] forks within [Timeframe, e.g., 6 months] as indicators of community interest and perceived value.
*   **User Feedback:** Receive positive feedback (e.g., via issues, discussions) highlighting improved workflow consistency, better context management, or enhanced AI reliability when using the template.
*   **Real-world Use:** See evidence (e.g., forks, community mentions) of the template being used or adapted for complex, real-world software projects beyond simple examples.

## Core Features:
*(This section remains largely the same, but ensures alignment with README)*
*(refer @/docs/feature_tasks.md for tasks and @/tasks/task_plan.md for task status tracking)*
1.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Respects Cursor, CLINE, RooCode Rule guidelines and mechanisms natively.
2.  **Latest Compatibility:** Designed to be compatible with the latest versions of supported platforms.
3.  **Minimal Token Usage:** Organized rule files to leverage platform-specific loading mechanisms where possible.
4.  **Common Memory Bank:** A structured documentation system (`docs/`, `tasks/`) provides shared, persistent context.
5.  **Fundamental Software Engineering Principles:** Integrates established practices for planning, implementation, debugging, and documentation.
6.  **User Customization & Extensibility:** Provides clear guidelines and structure allowing users to easily adapt the rules and Memory Bank templates to fit specific project requirements or personal workflow preferences.
7.  **Onboarding & Community Support:** Includes comprehensive documentation, quick start guides, and examples to facilitate easy adoption, along with clear contribution guidelines to foster community involvement and improvement.
